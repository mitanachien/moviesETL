The goal of this data engineering project is to do the ETL in Azure DataBricks. Working with Delta Lake, I managed the raw movie data by adding data information like data source, ingested date, and status as the Bronze table. From Bronze table to Silver table, I did data processing and saved the clean data to the Silver tables: movie Silver and genre Silver as the look-up table. After that, I updated the status in Bronze data from 'new' to 'loaded' and 'quarantined' for the clean and dirty data separately. Finally, in the update Silver table step, I cleaned the quarantined data in the Bronze table and saved them to the Silver tables.
